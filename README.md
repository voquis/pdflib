# PDF Lib
This PHP library is intended to be used within business applications to simplify generating PDF documents.  The library is optimised for regular A4 pages and supports the following document types:
- Invoices
- Purchase Orders
- Credit Notes
- Timesheets
- Factory Acceptance Test forms
- Site Acceptance Test forms
- Work Instructions

# Installation
Please note this library requires the PHP ```gd``` extension if displaying images on documents.  Depending on the platform, ```libpng-dev``` may need to be installed.  The related [API project](https://github.com/voquis/pdfapi) illustrates how to make use of this library.


# Credits
This library is built upon the [TCPDF](https://tcpdf.org/) library.
